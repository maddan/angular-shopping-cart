I used Angular CLI for the ease of development since it gives your the bolerplate app so that you can focus only on the logic. I used Angular Material to make use of the table the library provides. I used mock data for the cart so that i can go through the list and push them to better get the total cost for the Shopping Cart. Also, added the deals that go along with the items added.

Some improvements I could have done better:
- Currently deals are hardcoded and only works for the Mock data. I would need to remove the hardcoding part and add better logic.
- Leverage more use of Angular material library.
- Maybe add routing functionality to go back and forth between the list and add to cart for better experience.
